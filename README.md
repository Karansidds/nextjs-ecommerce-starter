This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) eCommerce starter bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Libraries

This starter supports [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). It uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org) as it's state management solution and [Tailwind CSS](https://redux.js.org) as a utility library. A UI library has not been used as everyone has their own preferences. I would prefer using [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) or [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
